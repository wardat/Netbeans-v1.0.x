<HTML><BODY>
A system option,
complete with sample static property state; getters and setters;
property change firing; property name constants; a default
instance; and bean info including display names and tool tips;
large and small icons (included); package-private convenience
routines to access localized strings and formats; and a sample
custom property editor.

<p>The default executor lets you see the option actually inside the IDE,
useful for e.g. testing out complex property editors.
