<HTML><BODY>
An executor (with bean info and icon)
that loads the supplied class using a special classloader inside the IDE that can
access the Repository and automatically redirect I/O streams. The executor shows you
how to get a new instance of the class and do something with it, wrapping the whole
process in an object which permits the user to terminate it like any other process.

<p>The default (meta-)executor lets you try out your executor on a sample file.
