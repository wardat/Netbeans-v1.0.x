<HTML><BODY>
Action sensitive to the current node selection.
You probably want to use <code>Cookie_action</code> instead
if that is appropriate, since it is better to depend on a node's
cookies than the actual node itself.

<p>The default executor runs the action inside the IDE on a prompted-for
node or nodes.
