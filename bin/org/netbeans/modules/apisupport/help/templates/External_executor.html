<HTML><BODY>
An executor (with bean info and icon)
which runs classes by means of passing their names as arguments to some external
process, usually the Java launcher, perhaps with some wrapper class. The template
supports user-configurable process launching formats with substitutable strings,
and shows you how to add your own substitutable tokens to the process format.

<p>The default (meta-)executor lets you try out your executor on a sample file.
