<HTML><BODY>
An action
which cannot be called directly, but when displayed in a menu (or
popup) will show a submenu of items which you can configure, and
you can configure what is done when one of them is
selected.

<p>The default executor shows how the action will look in a sample context,
and lets you actually try it inside the IDE.
