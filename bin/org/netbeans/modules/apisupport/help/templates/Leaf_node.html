<HTML><BODY>
A subclass of <code>AbstractNode</code> representing a leaf
(i.e. it has no children). There is commented-out code for many different things which can
be done with the node, such as adding a property sheet, customizing the context menu,
customizing cut/copy/delete/rename, the display name/icon/context help associations,
adding cookies, and providing a customizer component. The template includes icons.

<p>The default executor lets you see a test sample of the node inside the IDE.
