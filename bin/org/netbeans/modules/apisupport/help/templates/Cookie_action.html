<HTML><BODY>
Perhaps the most natural type of action. It is conditionally
enabled whenever nodes are selected which have the requested
cookies (pluggable capabilities). Many standard IDE actions
fall into this category.

<p>Remember that besides cookies in <code>org.openide.cookies</code>,
some other things are also cookies and may be used with these
actions: data objects; and Java Hierarchy elements.

<p>The default executor runs the action inside the IDE on a prompted-for
node or nodes.
