Just as Java's <samp>CLASSPATH</samp> must contain the correct
hierarchy of directories and archives to access the
required packages and classes, the point at which you mount
new file systems in the IDE <strong>Filesystems</strong> is
very important.

<p>Make sure you mount a directory that contains the default
package. For example, if you have classes in package
<code>com.yoyodyne.spreadsheet</code>, and they are contained in
directory
<code>C:\JavaDevel\source\com\yoyodyne\spreadsheet\</code>, be sure
to mount the directory <code>C:\JavaDevel\source\</code>.

<p>Similarly, when using JAR files, be sure that Java packages
match the position of classes in the JAR. Java requires you to do
this too, so it is a good habit.
