for compilation, execution, and debugging for each project. Open this window by 
choosing <strong>Project | Settings...</strong> from the main menu.

execution, and debugging in the right pane.

<p>If you select the <code>Compiler Types</code>, <code>Execution Types</code>, or 
<code>Debugger Types</code> node, you can configure the compilers, executors, or debuggers themselves.
