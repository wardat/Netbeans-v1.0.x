Forte for Java has contextual menus all over the IDE that you can 
invoke by right-clicking. This saves you from having to look for the appropriate command in the main menus. 
Here are just a few examples:</p>

<p>Right-click on a node in the Explorer to get a list of all commands 
available for that object.</p>

<p>Right-click in the Main Window for a list of toolbars to display.</p>

<p>Right-click on the Workspace tabs in the Main Window to configure Workspaces.</p>

<p>Right-click on the Watches node in the Debugger Window to add a watch.</p>
