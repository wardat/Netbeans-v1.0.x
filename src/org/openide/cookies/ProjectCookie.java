* IDE (change workplaces, control panel options, and the content of
* filesystem pool). Moreover the project has a so-called "Project Desktop"
* that should provide a default working node for the developer to store working
* files, and also to describe the capabilities of the project (for example
* if the project can the compiled, the node should support {@link CompilerCookie}).
* <P>
* To let the project save settings when explicitly asked to or when the project is 
* closed, {@link #projectSave} is used. It is called when another project is opened. 
* The method should store the current state of IDE to be restored on next opening.
* <P>
* To allow the IDE to remember the current project when it the IDE is closed
* and to reopen it on next startup, the project is required to be serializable.
