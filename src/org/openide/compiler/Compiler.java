    * The suggested implementation is to call the super method, and then return a {@link java.util.List}
    * containing both the super's result, as well as any information added
    * by this subclass.

    * <p>Additionally, in the unusual but possible case that a compiler is subclassing another
    * compiler, while still using the same compiler group class as its superclass, the subclass compiler <em>must</em>
    * include in the key (e.g. an additional vector element) the class object for the subclass (determined via a static class
    * constant, <em>not</em> {@link Object#getClass}!)--this will ensure that keys from unrelated subclasses of the
