<HTML><BODY>
An example class with private functionality that can be unit-tested
via a static inner testing class.

<p>Its default compiler will move the classfile for the <code>TEST</code>
inner class to a scratch directory outside of Filesystems.
Its default executor will likewise run the <code>TEST</code> class's <code>main</code>
method rather than the outer class, and will include the scratch directory in
the execution classpath.
