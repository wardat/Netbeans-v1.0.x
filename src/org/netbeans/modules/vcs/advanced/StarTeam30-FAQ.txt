StarTeam 3.0 FAQ

Q: How can I add new directory to the project ?
A: StarTeam 3.0 does not allow you to do this via command 
   line interface. Do it with Windows StarTeam client, 
   then isuue the Refresh command.

Q: What values should I use for login/password/hostname/port ?
A: Ask yout StarTeam administrator.

Q: What should I put into 'Root directory' field  and to 
   WORKING_DIR/PROJECT variables ?
A: You must know the 'Project/View' name from your StarTeam 
   administrator. (No way to figure it out using cmdline 
   interface.)

   Project specification has the following format:
   user[:password]@host[:port]/Project/View/PathName
   E.g. if your Project=Corona
                View=Gandalf
                PathName=Development
   and your Development directory can be found at w:/Development
   then set up:
    - Root directory=w:/Development
    - WORKING_DIR=w:/  
    - PROJECT=user:password@host:port/Corona/Gandalf/Development

   Setting up these three variables is the crucial point of the
   configuration.

Q: Why is it so slow ?
A: Ask StarTeam. {:)
