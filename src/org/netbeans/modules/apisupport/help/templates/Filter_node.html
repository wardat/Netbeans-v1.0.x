<HTML><BODY>
A node which just acts as a mirror of another node, usually
partially overriding the original's behavior. The template shows how to control which operations
and delegated to the original node, and which are performed on the filter node. It also includes
examples of adding cookies and properties (on the Property Sheet) to the original (the additions
being visible only in the filter). The template also includes a <code>FilterNode.Children</code>
implementation which permits you to also customize the appearance and behavior of the displayed
children of the filter node, such as specially mirroring the original node's children. There
are no icons in this template because usually the icon is delegated to the original node.
