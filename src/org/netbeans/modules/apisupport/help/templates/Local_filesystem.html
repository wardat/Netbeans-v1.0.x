<HTML><BODY>
An example local filesystem (i.e. one based on regular disk files).
Could be customized to include version-control support or any network transport, etc.

<p>Uses <code>AbstractFileSystem</code> as a superclass. Includes
example implementations of the various associated interfaces, as well
as commented-out code to handle custom context-menu actions, name and
icon annotations, and optimized copy/move implementations.

<p>This template includes the filesystem itself, associated BeanInfo,
a localized exception class, and icons. You could add a filesystem
customizer if you wished separately.
