<HTML><BODY>
A simple JavaHelp-compatible help
set, help map, table of contents, index, and sample home page for you.
For starters, you get a "home page"
for the module that will be displayed under <b>Help&nbsp;|
Features</b>. If you want to add context help, you must create
<code>HelpCtx</code> objects in the <code>getHelpCtx</code> methods
throughout your code; then add the IDs (by convention these may be
fully-qualified class names) to the help map, and point them to the
URL of an HTML page describing the feature. (You may want to put
anchors in the URLs too, to scroll to a specific part of a page.)
If you want JavaHelp search, that is not text-based so you should get
a proper JavaHelp authoring tool for this.
All of the JavaHelp files (except the actual HTML) can be edited as plain
text (with syntax highlighting) or as structured XML using the XML module.
