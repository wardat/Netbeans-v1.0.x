You can use any Java compiler to compile Java classes.
To define a new compiler the IDE can use, choose <strong>Project | Settings...</strong>
from the main menu and expand the <code>Compiler Types</code> node.

<p>Right-click on a category subnode and choose <strong>New <code><em>ServiceCategory</em></code> Compilation Service</strong>
from the contextual menu.  A subnode for the new compiler type will appear 
under the category node. You can then configure the new compiler type on its property sheet.

<p>On the property sheet for classes is a tab 
called <strong>Execution</strong>, with a property called <code>Compile</code>.
Set this property to your new compiler type.

<p>You can configure debugging and execution the same way, using the 
<code>Debugger Types</code> and 
<code>Execution Types</code> in <strong>Project Settings</strong>.
