You can customize the Main Window's menus and
toolbars in the Global Options window --
look for the nodes for <code>Actions</code> (a pool of available actions), <code>Menu</code>
(the main menu bar), and <code>Toolbars</code> (a list
of configurable toolbars). You can use the clipboard
(copy and paste) to reconfigure toolbars and menus to your taste.

<p>You can grab toolbars by their grips and rearrange them by dragging. If you right-click on 
an empty space in the toolbar area, a contextual menu will appear allowing you to add or remove
toolbars from the current configuration and to create new configurations.

<p>You can also make your own menu
and toolbar items. Just make a Java class with a <code>main</code>
method to do what you want. Then set it to use Internal Execution
(<code>Executor</code> property on the <strong>Execution</strong> tab 
on the source file's property sheet), and copy
&amp; paste it into a menu or toolbar in the  
<code>Menu</code> or <code>Toolbars</code> nodes in the Global Options window.
