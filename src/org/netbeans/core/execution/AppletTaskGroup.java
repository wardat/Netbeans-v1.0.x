/** Class that signalizes to input/output subsystem that special care
* is needed. Especially - all requests for output are handled by invokeLater
* call. This is important for HotJavaBean where following order of locking is kept
* AWTTreeLock, Document or Document; e.g we must be conscious that all subsequent
* calls that needs AWTTreeLock and already have Document lock can cause deadlock.
* Solution is never acquire the AWTTreeLock in thread that possibly holds Document lock.
* So process such calls as invokeLater.
